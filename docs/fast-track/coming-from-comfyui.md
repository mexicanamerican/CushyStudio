# Coming from ComfyUI

CushyStudio offers a modern, cross-platform user interface designed to enhance your experience with generative AI, used in conjunction with ComfyUI. It streamlines ComfyUI's complex node-based workflow, transforming your workflow into user-friendly "apps" featuring menus, sliders, and dialogue boxes. This design shift enables users to focus more on their creative projects and less on the intricacies of navigating through node graphs to access necessary information.
