# ðŸ‘‹ Getting Started

\##This page will contain a brief introduction, a warning that the software is a beta and to expect many changes over time. We will also explain to the user that the documentation will match feature parity with Cushy and link to the current changelog. _(Maybe this page also will mention the latest features and link directly to the pages about them? TBD)_
