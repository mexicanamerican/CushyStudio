# Intro to Generative AI

\##This might end up being it's own top level section if there is too much information. This page or section will contain:

* The Timeline of Generative AI, including the technologies that came and went, GAN, Diffusers, Etc
* A very brief overview of other frontends, very superficially, we aren't here to bash on other projects.
* A general overview of different model architectures along with their pros and cons.
* A general overview of LoRAs, Lycoris, LoCON, Hypernetworks and TIs
* Key concepts that are required for working with Generateive AI such as Prompting, CLIP Skip, CFG, ideal resolutions, Upscaling, inpainting, outpainting,
* Links to resources regarding more in depth articles and papers that describe the technology in depth for people who are interested.
* Links to valuable tutorials (Or we make our own.)
* Links to models and resources (Civitai/Tensorart?) Maybe...
