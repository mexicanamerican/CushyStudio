ComfyUI support includes working with Local, Managed, Remote, and Cloud ComfyUI instances. This allows for quick switching between various ComfyUI setups and parallelizing work across multiple instances.

Parallelizing load across multiple ComfyUI instances is made easy with features such as automatically downloading images into your local outputs folder, automatic uploading of missing files, and a powerful image hashing system to avoid duplicate uploads.

CushyStudio also offers native support for ComfyUI workflows in JSON format and images. Simply add them to the action folder to use them seamlessly within CushyStudio, with the option to convert them into actions in a single click.

## Full Large Language Model (LLM) support
