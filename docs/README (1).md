## Overview

"Welcome to Cushy Studio, a modern and cross-platform software designed for both play and work with Generative AI Art. Explore and build generative applications for images, videos, and 3D art, ushering in a glimpse of the future.

Cushy Apps are at the core of our platform, offering self-contained, task-oriented applications with user-friendly interfaces that make generative art accessible to everyone. Discover the perfect application tailored to your needs within the extensive Cushy Library, whether it's a versatile, general-purpose app or a highly specialized one designed for specific creative endeavors.

With the Cushy SDK, you can automate tasks and address niche use cases by creating your custom applications. Cushy Studio provides a suite of power-user tools to help you bring your dream "app" to life. Once your creation is ready, share it with the global creative community through the Cushy App Library.

At Cushy Foundation, we are committed to durability and innovation. Our project builds on proven technologies like ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion, FFmpeg, and ImageMagick. Featuring an extensible core and a professional user interface with dockable panes, Cushy is designed with developers and creative professionals in mind, and it is LLM-friendly. While the project is in its early stages, our founder (rvion) is dedicated to its growth. If you appreciate our work, consider sponsoring us to support our mission of advancing generative art."
